# iTiwi App Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the full tech stack and development plan for the iTiwi app, a mobile application designed to connect users with government services and local information, as depicted in the provided UI screenshots.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (Flutter)
- Framework: Flutter (latest stable version)
- Language: Dart
- UI Libraries & Tools:
  - Material Design (built-in Flutter widgets)
  - flutter_svg (for custom SVG icons like the clay pot logo)
  - animations package (for smooth transitions)
  - provider or riverpod (for state management)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code or Android Studio

### Backend
- Framework: Node.js with Express.js (lightweight & fast) or NestJS (more structured)
- API Type: REST API or GraphQL
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Cloud Functions: Firebase Functions (optional, for serverless backend)

### Database
- Main Database:
  - Firebase Firestore (NoSQL, real-time sync, works well with Flutter)
  - OR PostgreSQL (relational DB for structured data)
- Hosting:
  - Firebase Hosting (for serverless backend)
  - OR DigitalOcean / AWS RDS (for SQL databases)

### DevOps & Deployment
- Version Control: Git + GitHub or GitLab
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD for automatic build & deploy
- App Distribution:
  - Google Play Console (Android)
  - Apple App Store Connect (iOS)
- Monitoring: Firebase Crashlytics + Google Analytics

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Initialize Flutter project for frontend.
- Setup Node.js backend with Express.js or NestJS.
- Configure Firebase project (Firestore, Functions, Hosting) or PostgreSQL database.
- Setup version control repository (GitHub/GitLab).

### Phase 2: UI Implementation
- Implement onboarding screens, login/signup, and main navigation based on provided UI designs.
- Use flutter_svg for custom icons.
- Implement smooth animations using animations package.
- Setup state management with provider or riverpod.

### Phase 3: Backend API Development
- Design REST or GraphQL API endpoints for user authentication, emergency hotlines, e-services, business permits, news updates, and location data.
- Implement JWT authentication.
- Integrate with Firestore or PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Implement serverless functions if using Firebase Functions.

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Connect Flutter frontend with backend APIs.
- Implement real-time updates where applicable (e.g., Firestore listeners).
- Write unit and integration tests for frontend and backend.
- Perform manual and automated UI testing.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
- Setup CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
- Deploy backend to Firebase Hosting or cloud server.
- Publish mobile app to Google Play and Apple App Store.
- Setup monitoring with Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics.

## Notes
- Prioritize accessibility and responsiveness in UI.
- Ensure secure handling of user data and authentication.
- Optimize for performance and smooth user experience.
